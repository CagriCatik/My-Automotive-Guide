# FMEA (Failure Mode and Effects Analysis) Management System

**Objective:**  
To develop a web-based FMEA management system that allows users to record, track, and manage potential failure modes, their effects, and mitigation actions. The system will have a PostgreSQL database, a frontend built with Vue.js and Bootstrap, and a backend built with Next.js.

## 1. **Project Overview:**

- **System Name:** FMEA Management System
- **Technologies:**
  - **Frontend:** Vue.js, Bootstrap
  - **Backend:** Next.js
  - **Database:** PostgreSQL
- **Hosting:** Local deployment initially, with potential for cloud deployment (e.g., AWS, Heroku) later.
- **Users:**
  - Admins: Manage all aspects of the system including user management.
  - Users: Input and manage FMEA records.
  
## 2. **Functional Requirements:**

### 2.1 **User Authentication and Authorization:**

- **Sign Up/Sign In:** Users should be able to create an account and log in securely.
- **Roles:** Admin and standard user roles with varying access levels.
- **Authorization:** Ensure that only authorized users can create, edit, or delete records.

### 2.2 **FMEA Records Management:**

- **Create FMEA Records:** Users can create new FMEA records with the following fields:
  - Business Function
  - Process Step
  - Potential Failure Mode
  - Potential Failure Effects
  - Severity
  - Potential Causes
  - Occurrence
  - Current Process Controls
  - Detection
  - Recommended Actions
  - Responsibility
  - Actions Taken
- **View FMEA Records:** Display a table of FMEA records, sortable and filterable by various columns.
- **Edit FMEA Records:** Users can update existing records.
- **Delete FMEA Records:** Users can delete records.
- **Search Functionality:** Implement a search feature to find specific records by any of the fields.

### 2.3 **Data Visualization and Reporting:**

- **Risk Priority Number (RPN) Calculation:** Automatically calculate and display RPN based on severity, occurrence, and detection fields.
- **Reports:** Generate reports based on the data, including summaries and exportable data (CSV/PDF).
- **Graphs/Charts:** Visual representation of data (e.g., pie charts for failure mode distribution, bar charts for risk levels).

### 2.4 **Notifications and Alerts:**

- **Email Notifications:** Notify responsible parties via email when an action is due.
- **Dashboard Alerts:** Display alerts on the dashboard for upcoming or overdue actions.

## 3. **Non-Functional Requirements:**

### 3.1 **Performance:**

- The system should be responsive and load within 2 seconds for all views.
- Handle up to 10,000 concurrent users without performance degradation.

### 3.2 **Security:**

- **Data Protection:** Ensure that all data is securely stored and protected from unauthorized access.
- **SSL:** Use SSL for all communications to and from the server.
- **Password Encryption:** Store passwords using a strong hashing algorithm like bcrypt.
- **Input Validation:** Implement strong input validation to prevent XSS, SQL Injection, and other common attacks.

### 3.3 **Usability:**

- **Responsive Design:** The UI should be fully responsive and work on all major browsers and devices (mobile, tablet, desktop).
- **User-friendly Interface:** The system should be intuitive and easy to navigate.
- **Accessibility:** Follow WCAG guidelines to ensure the application is accessible to users with disabilities.

### 3.4 **Scalability:**

- The system architecture should support easy scaling to accommodate an increasing number of users and data volume.

### 3.5 **Maintainability:**

- The codebase should be modular and well-documented to facilitate easy maintenance and updates.

## 4. **Technical Requirements:**

### 4.1 **Frontend (Vue.js and Bootstrap):**

- **Vue.js Components:**
  - **Login/Register:** Component for user authentication.
  - **Dashboard:** Component for displaying user-specific information, alerts, and actions.
  - **FMEA Form:** Form component for adding and editing FMEA records.
  - **FMEA Table:** Component to display records in a tabular format, with sorting, filtering, and search functionality.
  - **Charts/Graphs:** Components to visualize data using libraries like Chart.js or D3.js.
- **Bootstrap:**
  - Use Bootstrap classes for layout and styling to ensure a responsive and clean design.
  - Custom styling for branding where necessary.
- **State Management:**
  - Use Vuex (or Pinia) for managing application state, especially for user sessions, FMEA data, and form states.

### 4.2 **Backend (Next.js):**

- **API Endpoints:**
  - **Authentication:** Endpoints for user registration, login, and token management.
  - **FMEA Management:** RESTful endpoints for creating, reading, updating, and deleting FMEA records.
  - **Reporting:** Endpoints for generating and exporting reports.
- **Database Integration:**
  - **ORM:** Use Sequelize or Prisma to manage PostgreSQL database interactions.
  - **Migrations:** Implement migrations for managing database schema changes.
- **Middleware:**
  - **Authentication Middleware:** To protect routes and ensure only authenticated users can access certain endpoints.
  - **Validation Middleware:** To validate incoming requests and sanitize data.

### 4.3 **Database (PostgreSQL):**

- **Schema Design:**
  - **Users Table:** Store user details, roles, and authentication data.
  - **FMEA Records Table:** Store all FMEA data fields.
  - **Logs Table:** Store logs of actions taken on FMEA records (for audit purposes).
- **Indexes:** Implement appropriate indexing for performance optimization on frequently queried fields.
- **Backups:** Set up automated daily backups with a retention period of at least 30 days.

## 5. **Development Workflow:**

### 5.1 **Version Control:**

- **Git Repository:** Set up a Git repository (e.g., on GitHub or GitLab) for source code management.
- **Branching Strategy:** Use Git Flow or a similar branching strategy to manage feature development, hotfixes, and releases.

### 5.2 **Development Environment:**

- **Local Development Setup:**
  - Dockerize the application for consistent development environments across team members.
  - Ensure local development environment mimics production with environment variables and configurations.
- **Continuous Integration:**
  - Set up CI/CD pipelines using tools like GitHub Actions, Travis CI, or Jenkins.

### 5.3 **Testing:**

- **Unit Testing:** Write unit tests for backend logic and frontend components using Jest (or another testing framework).
- **Integration Testing:** Test API endpoints and their interaction with the database.
- **End-to-End Testing:** Use Cypress or Selenium for automated end-to-end testing.
- **Performance Testing:** Test the system under load to ensure it meets performance requirements.

## 6. **Documentation:**

- **Code Documentation:** Inline comments and external documentation for complex code sections.
- **Setup Guides:** Provide setup guides for local development, testing, and deployment.

### 6.2 **User Documentation:**

- **User Manual:** Create a user manual detailing how to use the FMEA Management System.
- **Video Tutorials:** Optional, create short video tutorials for common tasks (e.g., adding a new FMEA record).

## 7. **Deployment Plan:**
