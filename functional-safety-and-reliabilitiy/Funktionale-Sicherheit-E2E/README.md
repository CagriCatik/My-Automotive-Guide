# Functional Safety E2E Communication

## Overview

This documentation provides an in-depth guide to the **End-to-End communication protection** mechanisms in functional safety systems. It is designed to help users understand the core concepts, safety mechanisms, parameterization, and tooling related to E2E in safety-critical environments, following the **ISO 26262** standard.

## Table of Contents

The documentation is structured as follows:

1. **Motivation and Goals**  
   Understand the key drivers and objectives of E2E communication protection.
   
2. **Communication Errors and Safety Mechanisms**  
   Explore the potential communication errors and the safety mechanisms used to detect and handle them.

3. **E2E Requirements in the Safety Concept**  
   Learn about system and component-level requirements for implementing E2E protection in the safety concept.

4. **E2E Basic Information**  
   Get an introduction to the fundamental concepts behind E2E communication.

5. **E2E Parameterization**  
   Step-by-step guide to configuring basic and advanced E2E parameters.

6. **Error Detection and Qualification Time Calculation**  
   Understand how to calculate error detection and qualification times, both with and without gateways.

7. **E2E State Machine**  
   Delve into the E2E state machine and its transition logic with default values.

8. **Application Reactions to E2E Status**  
   Recommendations for how applications should react to various E2E states.

9. **E2E Tooling and Usage**  
   Overview of tools like **XDIS** and **NCDC**, and how to use them for E2E configuration.

10. **E2E Signal Group Protection**  
    Learn how to identify and manage E2E-protected signal groups within ECU extracts.

11. **Enabling/Disabling E2E Check on Receiver Side**  
    Guidance on enabling or disabling the E2E check based on the state of the sender.
