# Application Function: Monitor Voltage

This document elaborates on an example of a runnable or function within your application, specifically focusing on monitoring the voltage supplied to the ECU (Engine Control Unit). It provides a detailed overview of the function's functionality, voltage conditions, interaction architecture, event handling, and additional modules involved. Additionally, code snippets are provided to illustrate the implementation of the `monitor_voltage` function.

## Overview

The provided function, `monitor_voltage`, serves a critical role in ensuring the stable operation of the ECU by periodically monitoring the voltage supplied to it. This function is essential for maintaining optimal performance and preventing potential damage caused by voltage fluctuations.

## Functionality

### Periodic Monitoring

The `monitor_voltage` function is designed to periodically sample and check the voltage level supplied to the ECU. This ensures that any deviations from the desired voltage range are promptly detected and addressed.

```c
void monitor_voltage() {
    // Periodically monitor the voltage
    while (1) {
        float voltage = read_voltage_sensor(); // Function to read voltage from sensor
        if (voltage < 8.0 || voltage > 15.0) {
            // Voltage out of range, report failure
            set_eventStatus(FAILED); // Function to report event status
        } else {
            // Voltage within range, report success
            set_eventStatus(PASSED); // Function to report event status
        }
        delay(1000); // Delay for periodic monitoring
    }
}
```

### Voltage Range Check

One of the primary tasks of the `monitor_voltage` function is to verify whether the voltage remains within the acceptable range. The ideal voltage range is defined as 8 to 15 Volts. Any voltage readings outside this range are considered abnormal and require appropriate action.

### Event Reporting

Based on the voltage condition detected, the `monitor_voltage` function generates event reports. If the voltage falls within the acceptable range, the event is marked as "passed." However, if the voltage deviates from the range, indicating either an under voltage or overvoltage condition, the event is flagged as "failed."

### Interaction via RTE

The function interacts with the Basic Software (BSW) indirectly through the Run-Time Environment (RTE) interface. This ensures proper communication and coordination between the application layer and the underlying software components.

## Voltage Conditions

### Passing Criteria

Voltages within the range of 8 to 15 Volts are considered acceptable for normal operation of the ECU.

### Under Voltage Condition

If the voltage drops below 8 Volts, it signifies an under voltage condition, which could potentially lead to system instability or malfunction.

### Over Voltage Condition

Conversely, if the voltage exceeds 15 Volts, it indicates an overvoltage condition, posing risks of component damage or failure.

## Interaction Architecture

The interaction architecture illustrates how the `monitor_voltage` function communicates with other software modules within the system:

- **RTE Integration**: The application layer communicates with the BSW components through the RTE, facilitating data exchange and function invocation.
- **Dem Integration**: Faults and anomalies detected by the `monitor_voltage` function are reported to the Diagnostic Event Manager (Dem) module for further analysis and handling.

## Event Handling

### Event Identification

The `monitor_voltage` function assigns unique Event IDs to different voltage conditions. Event ID 10 represents under voltage scenarios, while Event ID 11 corresponds to overvoltage situations.

### Fault Reporting

Upon detecting voltage anomalies, the `monitor_voltage` function reports corresponding faults to the Dem module. This ensures that any deviations from the expected voltage range are appropriately logged and addressed.

## Additional Modules

### Fault Management

The Dem module plays a pivotal role in managing and processing faults reported by both Application Software (ASW) and Basic Software (BSW) components. It facilitates fault diagnosis, logging, and resolution within the automotive system.

### Diagnostic Trouble Codes (DTCs)

Each event reported by the `monitor_voltage` function is associated with a Diagnostic Trouble Code (DTC). These codes provide valuable insights into the nature and severity of detected faults, aiding in efficient troubleshooting and maintenance.

## Conclusion

The `monitor_voltage` function exemplifies the critical role of voltage monitoring within automotive applications, particularly in ensuring the reliable operation of the ECU. By detecting and reporting voltage anomalies, this function contributes to the overall safety and performance of the vehicle. Additionally, the integration with other software modules such as the Dem enables comprehensive fault management and diagnostic capabilities within the automotive system.
