## Event Processing Overview

This README offers an in-depth explanation of the event processing mechanism within the system, providing comprehensive insights into various aspects of event handling, storage, and system behavior.

### Synchronous and Asynchronous Processing

Events within the system undergo processing either synchronously or asynchronously, depending on the system's design. Synchronous processing involves handling events in real-time within the reporting function, ensuring immediate response to triggers. Conversely, asynchronous processing allows for more flexible event handling, enabling events to be processed either synchronously or asynchronously based on specific design decisions and system requirements. This flexibility enhances the system's responsiveness and adaptability to varying conditions.

### Event Storage in Memory

The storage of events in memory is a critical aspect of the system's operation, facilitating the retention of essential data for diagnostic and analysis purposes. Event storage depends on various configuration parameters, particularly triggers, which determine when events are stored in memory. These triggers, such as "trigger on failed," "trigger on pending," or "trigger on confirmed," define the conditions under which events are stored based on their status and availability of memory resources. By intelligently managing event storage, the system optimizes memory utilization and ensures the preservation of crucial data.

### Active and Passive Status

Events are classified as active or passive based on their qualification status, such as pass or fail. Active events trigger specific actions or responses within the system, while passive events remain dormant until activated by specific conditions or triggers. The determination of an event's active or passive status is crucial for defining its behavior, processing, and subsequent storage. Bit values associated with events indicate their active or passive status, guiding the system in executing appropriate actions based on event qualification.

### Event Displacement

The limited availability of memory necessitates efficient event displacement mechanisms to prioritize the storage of critical data. Event displacement involves replacing existing event memory entries with new ones, ensuring the retention of significant event data while discarding less essential information. Configuration parameters, including "None," "Full," or "Priority occ," dictate the criteria for event displacement, allowing the system to intelligently manage memory resources and optimize data retention.

### Storage of Freeze Frame (FF) Data

Freeze frame (FF) data captures crucial information associated with events at the time of occurrence, facilitating fault diagnosis and analysis. Similar to event storage, FF data storage follows predefined conditions based on configurable parameters. Triggers such as "on FDC_Threshold" or "on test failed" determine when FF data is captured and stored in memory, enabling efficient retrieval and analysis of diagnostic information.

### Synchronous and Asynchronous Capturing of FF Data

The capturing of FF data can occur either synchronously or asynchronously, depending on system requirements and configuration settings. Synchronous capturing involves capturing FF data within reporting functions, ensuring immediate availability for diagnostic purposes. In contrast, asynchronous capturing defers FF data capture to subsequent cycles of system functions, enhancing system efficiency and resource utilization. Configuration parameters dictate the capturing mode, allowing the system to adapt to varying operational needs and optimize FF data management.

### Startup Behavior

During system startup, the Dem module undergoes pre-initialization and full initialization phases, setting the stage for efficient operation. Pre-initialization, facilitated by the `Dem_Preinit` function, occurs before Nvm initialization and enables fault reporting via `Dem_ReportErrorStatus`. Full initialization, initiated by `Dem_Init` after Nvm initialization, initializes software components and monitors, paving the way for comprehensive fault processing and system functionality.

### Suppression of DTC Output

The suppression of Diagnostic Trouble Code (DTC) output allows for the hiding of specific DTCs from external testers, providing flexibility in managing fault visibility. Configuration parameters, such as `DEM_Dtc_suppression`, facilitate runtime decision-making regarding DTC suppression, enabling selective disclosure of fault information based on specific market requirements or operational considerations.

### Availability of Events Visibility and Computation

Configurable parameters dictate the availability of events for processing within the system, essential for post-build configurations and variant switching. Events marked as unavailable are excluded from processing, streamlining system operation and resource utilization. This configurability enhances the system's adaptability to varying operational scenarios and facilitates efficient post-build configurations.

### Important APIs in Dem

The Dem module provides a set of essential APIs for efficient event handling, monitoring, and diagnostic functionality. These APIs encompass a wide range of functionalities, including event status retrieval, fault detection, FF data retrieval, and DTC management, enabling comprehensive system monitoring and diagnostic capabilities. Understanding and leveraging these APIs optimally enhances the functionality and performance of the Dem module within the system architecture, ensuring robust fault detection and diagnostic capabilities.
