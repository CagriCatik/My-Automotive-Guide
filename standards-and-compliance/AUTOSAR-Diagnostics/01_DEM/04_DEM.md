# Status Byte Explanation

In this README, we provide a comprehensive breakdown of each bit within the status byte, elucidating their roles, activation conditions, and reset criteria in detail.

## Bit 0: Event Status

- **Initial Status**: False.
- **Meaning**: This bit reflects the status of the event. When False, it indicates normal operation. Conversely, when True, it signifies that the event has failed.
- **Activation**: Upon receipt of a failed event status, triggered either by the `setEventStatus` function for Application Software (ASW) faults or the `ReportErrorStatus` function for Basic Software (BSW) faults.
- **Reset Conditions**: Reverts to False upon receiving a passed event status or upon invoking the `ResetEventStatus` API for the corresponding event ID.

## Bit 1: Test Failed This Operation Cycle

- **Initial Status**: False.
- **Meaning**: This bit tracks whether the event has encountered failure at least once during the ongoing operation cycle.
- **Activation**: Set to True upon occurrence of an event failure.
- **Reset Conditions**: Returns to False upon initiation of a new operation cycle or upon clearing Diagnostic Trouble Codes (DTC).

## Bit 2: Pending DTC Logic

- **Initial Status**: False.
- **Meaning**: Indicates the pending status of Diagnostic Trouble Code (DTC) logic associated with the event.
- **Activation**: Becomes True upon consecutive event failures.
- **Reset Conditions**: Resets to False upon meeting specific conditions, including successful operation cycles and DTC clearance.

## Bit 3: Confirmed DTC

- **Initial Status**: False.
- **Meaning**: This bit signifies whether the DTC associated with the event has been confirmed.
- **Activation**: Set to True upon reaching a predefined failure threshold.
- **Reset Conditions**: Resets to False upon fulfilling aging criteria, clearing DTC, or overwriting fault records.

## Bit 4: Test Not Completed Since Last Clear

- **Initial Status**: True.
- **Meaning**: Indicates whether the test for the event is pending since the last DTC clear.
- **Activation**: By default, set to True; transitions to False upon completing the test.
- **Reset Conditions**: Returns to True upon executing a clear DTC command.

## Bit 5: Test Failed Since Last Clear

- **Initial Status**: False.
- **Meaning**: Reflects whether the event has failed since the last DTC clear.
- **Activation**: Set to True upon event failure.
- **Reset Conditions**: Reverts to False upon fulfilling aging criteria, clearing DTC, or overwriting fault records.

## Bit 6: Test Not Complete This Operation Cycle

- **Initial Status**: True.
- **Meaning**: Indicates whether the test for the event remains pending in the ongoing operation cycle.
- **Activation**: Set to False upon completing a test during the current operation cycle.
- **Reset Conditions**: Returns to True upon initiating a new operation cycle or executing a clear DTC command.

## Bit 7: Warning Indicator Requested

- **Initial Status**: False.
- **Meaning**: Signifies whether a warning indicator (e.g., malfunction indicator lamp) is requested due to the event.
- **Activation**: Set to True upon event failure and meeting specific indicator thresholds.
- **Reset Conditions**: Resets to False through a process known as healing, executing a clear DTC command, or fulfilling indicator-off criteria.

## Healing Process

The healing process involves resetting certain status bits, such as the Warning Indicator Requested bit (Bit 7), by meeting specific criteria. This includes passing multiple operation cycles to reset the bit to False.

These comprehensive explanations offer detailed insights into the functioning of each bit within the status byte, facilitating a thorough understanding of their behavior and implications.
