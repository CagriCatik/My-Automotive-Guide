This chapter introduces the AUTOSAR standard and its importance in the automotive industry. It includes key objectives, the history of AUTOSAR, and its general architecture.

### 2. Application
Covers the Application Layer in AUTOSAR, describing how software components are designed, developed, and integrated into automotive systems. This chapter also includes details on component interaction and service interfaces.

### 3. Runtime Environment (RTE)
Explains the AUTOSAR Runtime Environment, the middleware layer responsible for communication between software components and Basic Software (BSW). The chapter covers how the RTE provides standardized communication services.

### 4. Basic Software (BSW)
This chapter focuses on the Basic Software (BSW) modules that AUTOSAR provides for hardware abstraction, ECU management, and communication services. Each BSW module will be explored in detail to understand how they interface with the system's hardware.

### 5. Methodology
Learn about the development methodology in AUTOSAR, from system design and configuration to code generation and integration. The methodology chapter guides you through each step of the development process.

### 6. Praxis
The Praxis chapter offers practical examples and real-world case studies demonstrating the implementation of AUTOSAR systems. It provides valuable insights into how AUTOSAR is applied in different automotive projects.

### 7. Glossary
A comprehensive glossary that defines key terms and concepts used throughout the book, ensuring clarity and understanding for all readers.
