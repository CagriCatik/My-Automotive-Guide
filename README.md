# Automotive Standards and Tools

This repository provides a structured collection of resources related to key automotive tools, standards, protocols, and testing methodologies. It is intended to help automotive engineers and developers navigate the complex landscape of vehicle software, communication protocols, diagnostics, and functional safety.

## Structure

### 1. Automotive Tools
This folder contains tools widely used in the automotive industry for the development, testing, calibration, and diagnostics of Electronic Control Units (ECUs). Examples of tools include:
- **CANape**: A tool used for measurement, calibration, and diagnostics of ECUs.
- **CANoe**: Software for the simulation, testing, and analysis of automotive bus systems such as CAN, LIN, FlexRay, and Ethernet.
- **TargetLink**: A tool for generating production code from Simulink models.
- **INCA**: A tool for ECU measurement and calibration.

### 2. Communication Protocols
This folder houses documentation and resources on various communication protocols used in automotive systems:
- **CAN**: Controller Area Network, a standard vehicle bus for communication.
- **LIN**: Local Interconnect Network, a low-cost communication network for automotive devices.
- **FlexRay**: A high-speed protocol for communication within vehicles.
- **SOME-IP**: A protocol for communication between ECUs over IP networks.
- **DoIP**: Diagnostics over Internet Protocol, used for vehicle diagnostics.
- **ETHERNET**: Used for high-speed communication in modern vehicles.
- **XCP**: A protocol for measurement and calibration of ECUs.

### 3. Diagnostic and Testing Protocols
This folder focuses on protocols and methodologies for diagnostics and testing in automotive systems:
- **Diagnostics**: General resources on vehicle diagnostics and testing tools.
